# BME 580 project - Building a Model to Study Stress Using Wearable Sensors
**Author**: Seijung Kim, Jiayue Liu, Achudh Balaraman
**GitHub repo**: seij001/BME580

## Database Information
Our open-source training dataset comes from a study conducted by researchers at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. You can find this original dataset in the **"Stress_dataset"** folder. The data description of the dataset can be found here: https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.5hqbzkh6f. This dataset also has an associated publication: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01361-y

## Files Included and Instructions to Run
Currently, the R scripts for our pre-processing and Exploratory Data Analysis are scattered in different scripts. We list those scripts and explain what kind of information you can find in each. We also list the data files you need to download to be able to run the scripts.
1. **Proposal graphs.Rmd** - RMD file where Achudh performed EDA on data. This Rmd file mainly includes distributions and density plots. - make sure to download **stress_all_sensorAchudh.csv** and **SurveyResults.xlsx**
* Proposal graphs.html - output file of Proposal graphs.rmd
* Allstress.png - Output from Proposal graphs.Rmd EDA stacked bar graph of all patient instances of every stress level
* Density7a.png - Output from Proposal graphs.Rmd EDA of patient 7aâ€™s sensor dsitribution by stress level for all events
2. **bme580_project_EDA.Rmd** - RMD file where Seijung performed EDA. This Rmd file includes correlation matrices of different sensor modalities at different stress levels and a sample plot of sensor recordings (for EDA, HR, and skin temperature) and self-reported stress levels over the duration of a recording session.
* Please make sure to download **stress_all_sensor.csv** and **stress_all_sensor_7A_1587298286.csv** along with the Rmd file.
3. **PCA_stress.Rmd** : Jiayue's script for PCA. performs PCA analysis on the stress dataset. You need **stress_all_sensor.csv** file to run this code. 
4. **Preprocessing.ipynb**: the code for combining all sensor data and survey results. Make sure you download the **7A folder** and **SurveyResults.xlsx** to run this code.
